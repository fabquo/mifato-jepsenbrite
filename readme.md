## Learning Objectives

- Dealing with an change in your team -> requires skills : solution oriented, team player, team manager.
- Re-organised the code and the DB. Remember : "To do and undo, it's always part of the job"
- Going deeper in PHP and SQL

## The Mission

Henry Fiesta, the client of the project Jepsen Brite is very enthusiast after the presentation of your job, and now he would like to add new features to his website to be in better position on the market.

Unfortunaletely, a member of your team was contacted by a headhunter and he decided to leave your team for an another one !

But don't worry ! Your boss has already engaged a new colleague who will integrate your team. Explain him your work on the project and how your code works.

### Finish the previous job

The project may not contain all the features of the basic application.

You must finalize these functionalities which are essential to achieve the new functionalities.

Also, if you have some bugs, you have to correct them.

You will have to do everything in your power to ensure that all the new features can be implemented and work perfectly.

### New features



1.  Possibility to register to an event Homepage

It makes sense, the users should have the possibility to participate to an event. Add a button where a user can show he will participate to the event.

Also, a list of participants should be displayed on the Page Event.

2. Subcategories

You have categories, this is nice, but Henry would like to go more deeply. He would like to implement subcategories.

For example, for the category concert, you should tell which kind of music it is : classic, pop, reggaeton, metal...

An event can have several subcategories. For example, if Amon Amarth plays an acoustic concert, your user should see : acoustic and metal for this event.

Create at least 2 events with 2 subcategories.

3.  User private dashboard

Create a dashboard for the user, so he could manage his events.

The dashboard should at least shows :
- a list of events he will participate
- a list of events he participated
- a list of events he created 
 
 4. Add administrator account

 Henry would like to keep the control of his website. So, he would like an admin account which gives him the possibility to delete :

- fake events
- users
- comments

His account must have the same rights as a user (create and update events, comments).

5. A video or an image

When a user create an event, he should have the choice to display an image or a video url (like YouTube, Vimeo..) to illustrate his event.

6. Adress and Map
An event must have an adress. On the Event page, the localisation should be displayed on a map.

You can use for example Google Maps or OpenStreetMap.

### Bonus

 - If an event is modified, all the users registered should be informed either by a message, by a notification or by an email (or the all together).
 - Send a message, notification or email one day before an event occur to the users registered.

### Deployement

The previous version is already online. Update it (you don't need to create a new one).

Encouragement
Have good times !
